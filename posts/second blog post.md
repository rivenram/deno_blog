#  This is my second blog post!

Continuing from my previous post, in this blog post I would expand and talk about my progress on my p5 sketch.

After a while, I did other assignments and finally came back to this. I thought that doing the rainbow background is just for 'fun' and intended to change it later, but before I changed it, I showed it to a friend, and discussed if I should really go down this "funky" road. He said that since the assignment barely has any requirements, this is my chance to create whatever I want and I should just commit to this, so I did. 

I looked at the assignment brief and went through the concept points. I Googled each concepts to find examples and inspiration, and stumbled upon this interesting usage of arrays, creating a [snowing animation](https://editor.p5js.org/Rivenrh/sketches/B2sxHUSve), and I combined it with my rainbow background.

Since I duplicated the assignment example as the base for my sketch, I really liked the [bouncing box](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/tg2BVPSKS) on it. So initially I intended to mess around with it just for fun, but that thought progresses into me actually wanted to add it to my sketch. But just straight up copying it isn't original and I won't get good mark on it, so I changed everything from the shape, color, bounce speed, bounce height, etc before finally adding it to my sketch. Oh and I added a simple mouse pointer too.
