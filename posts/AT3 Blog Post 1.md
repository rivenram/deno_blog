#  Gathering ideas and planning for AT3.

3rd and last assignment for this course. 
Personally, I really like the main idea of the assignment. Immediately my objective for this assignment was to code something beneficial and useful, something that I or others can actually use. This means that I don't want to code something just for the assignment and completely forgets about it afterwards.

My main concern was the filming part.
I'm not really a camera person, which means that filming was the hardest requirements for me.
This requirement limits my ideas for the assignment as well. I'd say good ideas often comes to me, but when I think about how can I film it and are the situation designed worth to film, immediately I discarded the idea and go to think of another.

I watched videos on YouTube for inspirations, and I thought of something that's related to the 2 previous point I wanted (Something useful and not too hard to film). 
It's a timelapse video.
After that, I started to pay attention in my daily life- what am I doing that can be further improved or enhanced with a helpful computer program.

A bit unrelated, but this is the [video](https://youtu.be/wIIGCTIpRMk) that randomly popped the ideas into my head.

In the end, I got 2 ideas that I want to do: To create something that I & my overseas friends can use (Maybe a chatbox, drawing canvas, etc), or a simple calculator.

Why a calculator?
One of my hobbies are playing TCG (Trading Card Games) such as Yugioh, Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, etc.
The idea came to me when I was playing Yugioh with my friends during our weekly casual card game night.
So basically in order to win in Yugioh, you need to deal 8000 damage to your opponents Life Points. The thing is, it is very annoying and tedious to track the current state of both players Life Points. Usually we just use a pencil and a piece of paper, then we do the maths ourselves. This hinders our game since instead of completely focusing on the game, we have to try to remember or keep track of our Life Points.

Now, I need to do more research on these 2 ideas before finally deciding on which idea to do.

## Current plan
1. Gather ideas and resources, decide on what to do.
2. Do research on creating the program using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
3. Code the program.
4. Make it live on the internet, then send it to friends for testing.
5. Once it's working properly, film it at a friend's place (Using Phone camera & a tripod).
6. Edit the video before submitting it.

Ultimately, I decided to do the Yugioh Life Points calculator. Because as I did my research on both programs, I found that the simple calculator was simpler and easier to do. Time is another factor as it's the final weeks of the semester, and I have 2 other major assignments due on on the same week.

*Fun Fact: While the official rule states that both player starts with 8000 Life Points, the TV show always uses 4000. This is to shorten the duration of the game, saving time and so that it fits in the 25 minutes mark (Standard duration of an Anime episode).
