#  Filming & Editing the video

Since I don't have any professional filming or recording tool such as a camera, I opted for the simple phone + tripod instead.

First, I talked to my friends about my plan, and basically asked them are they okay with me filming us and at his place. Being the wonderful friends they are, they easily consent to it. Then when the day came when we would gather and play card games, I brought my tripod and positions it in a place where it can get a good view of us from above, so it can capture us using the calculator as well.

I ended up recording 2 videos: 1 of us just playing, hanging out like usual, and the other video is a timelapse.

What happened was very satisfying. The calculator actually works and is useful, replacing the usual tedious, mundane task that is keeping track of the current Life Points on a piece of paper.

Once I got the videos, I edited them with Adobe Premiere Pro. I watched a lot of video essays and took heavy inspiration from them, in terms of the video design and format.

My video format is:
- Introduction and expositions
- Timelapse of me coding the calculator
- Timelapse of us using the calculator while we play
- Add in Copyright-free BGM
- Add in a bit of humour and memes (Optional)

After that, I gather images for references, wrote my script, find [copyright-free music](https://youtu.be/slt_Bav8nsQ), and record my voiceover. I need background music so the video won't have that awkward silence during the timelapse scenes. 
Then I combined all of those into a 4-minute video. When I edit the video, I made sure to include the 3 important things on the assignment brief and made them clear.
Oh and the humour, I simply had the urge to add that [yugioh meme](https://youtu.be/-sDExe3GcBg) to the video lol.

As usual, after I'm done editing it, I showed it to my friends and asked for their opinion, and do they think the video was able to convey the 3 important points well. Then, I edited and refined the video based on their feedback before uploading it.

Finally, I uploaded the [video to Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/831901197), then submits the link.

In conclusion, I think this assignment are quite fun, though at first I didn't really like the filming part as I'm not really a camera person, but thankfully the process turns out to be quite fun. I guess this is one of those "It's fun if you enjoy it" moments. Definitely thinks that doing a topic that you like/hobby helps a lot, in both motivation and ideas.

I really enjoyed this Creative Coding course. This course introduced me to the capabilities of what coding can do and create. Before this class, I legitimately thought that code are more of a Backdoor thing, creating things that work behind the scenes- to make a game, software, or program works. I didn't expect that code can be utilized to create something interesting visually as well.
Big thanks to Thomas, my teacher. I learned a lot from this course and I really enjoyed the class and lastly, BIG Thank you for the semester!
