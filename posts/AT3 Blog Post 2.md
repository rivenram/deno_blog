# Identifying my CoP

I've realized that doing the calculator also has a better CoP compared to the online chatbox thing. Since I will be filming at my casual weekly card game night with the boys, I believe my CoP would be:

- Domain = A friend's place, where we usually gather to play card games.
- Repertoire = Playing card games (Yugioh), hanging out
- Values = Me & the boys just chilling, hanging out, and relaxing at end of the week.

##  Coding the calculator.
 
Following [video](https://youtu.be/QS6Y0ezhyCs) [tutorials](https://youtu.be/Exo7zmvRePs) on YouTube, I decided to use the design from the 2nd video tutorials.
The reason for it was since the calculator is used to calculate and record the current state of the Life Points, I want the screen to be less cluttered. Thus, I removed the clickable number button so people can just simply use their phone/keyboard to type in the numbers. And since it will record the Life Points of 2 players, I added a 2nd calculator on the same screen. I also put them side by side because it is much easier to see on a horizontal screen.
For the calculator design itself, I went for the simple, minimalist look so it won't be too distracting (Important point as the purpose of it was to be a helpful tool).

Uploaded it on to [Github](https://rivenram.github.io/mycelial/), so the calculator is live on the internet and others can use it as well. 

Then I send the link to my friends so they can test it on their screen & to make sure that it's live.

"Does it work"
"Yes. It works on phone too"
"Ok thanks"
