#  This is my third blog post!

Final post for this assignment! I will again talk about my progress on my sketch and some thoughts and the finishing touch of it.

In the last blog post, I mentioned that I created a mouse pointer color for an idea that I have, and that idea is to make the 'RMIT' text clickable. So I Googled for references and found a very helpful website [tutorial](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/p5js/input/clickable-text) that gives an example and teach how to create it. I followed it and applied it to my sketch.

But then, I suddenly had an amusing idea. I originally intended to redirect the text to the RMIT official website, but since I already commited to go funky all the way, I redirected it to *that*. Sorry not sorry lol!

After everything is done, I did the final adjustment such as the sizes, tidying the code, adding comments, writing blog posts, and all that, except for the *class* concept for the assignment point. I Googled it for references and tried applying it to my sketch, but I just can't get it to work. Tried creating a class for each part of my sketch, but none of them works. So regrettably I gave up on it and just go on with my current sketch.

Finally, I present to you my final 'funky' p5 Javascript sketch for Creative Coding assignment 1.
