This is my first blog post!

I'm Riven, an International student currently studying in RMIT, Melbourne.
I am interested in coding and digital design, and that is why I am currently studying Digital Media Design.
I created this blog for my Creative Coding class.

For the 1st assignment of this class, I have to create a sketch using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! 

Since this is my first time ever on coding with Javascript, I am interested in it as I've heard that Javascript is an easy and fast coding language. I also need to create a Deno blog, using an interesting method with Windows cmd and github, which are pretty confusing to me (for now) since I used to create a simple blog using Wix templates (in my other classes), but I'll learn to use it as I continue on with my Uni.

Deno blog aside, I really am interested in p5 Javascript as in class, I can see how typing simple code can results in amazing and interesting sketches, which you can utilize math-like function to create even more interesting sketches such as animation, interaction, sounds, etc.
I like this assignment since it's basically free-for-all. There are only 2 simple rules and I can basically create whatever I want.

For starters, I tried to create something from scratch, but starting from 0 is hard and I'm not getting any ideas, I duplicated the example provided and make my way through there.
