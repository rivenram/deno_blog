#  This is my first blog post!

I created this blog for my Creative Coding class.

For the 1st assignment of this class, I have to create a sketch using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! 

I am interested in coding with Javascript since I heard that Javascript is an easy and fast coding language. Used to write blog posts with Wix template, this time I have to create a Deno blog, a blog that utilizes interesting methods. The methods are confusing to me, but I'll learn to utilize it as I continue on.

Deno blog aside, p5 Javascript is interesting because how by typing codes, it can create amazing creation such as animations, interaction, and more. Personally, this first assignment is fun because it has almost no requirements.

I tried to create something from scratch, but starting from 0 is hard and I'm not getting any ideas, so I duplicated the example provided and expands from there. I watched the YouTube tutorial playlist provided and get the hang of the basics.

Since this assignment is basically free-for-all, I can create whatever I want, but the real question is can I actually code in my ideas and make it work? So I started from the very basic = changing the background colour. I decided to make it funky and funny so I want to make it ever-changing, or at least rainbow-colored. 

I remembered the lecture about color and I browsed the course module and found the p5 page about color. There, I found a color example that has a [changing background color](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/GGKmdZuVg).

I copied the code to my sketch, removed the unneeded parts and only applied the changing rainbow color for my background, resulting in this:
